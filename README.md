# Lia Chat Bot

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.4.

## About

Lia-Chatbot was first a repo for me to learn how to deploy an angular page to GithubPages. Then, it evolved to include a Continuous Integration with Travis. And at this moment, it's evolving again to be a personal chatbot using Dialogflow. It can evolve again anytime, who knows.

## Objectives 

   - [x] Github Deploy
   - [x] Travis CI
   - [ ] Chatbot (Loading...)
   - [x] Telegram Integration
